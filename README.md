# ExampleProjects
There is no licensing and the ideas are far from original.
The purpose behind these apps is to get from Idea-to-Function as quickly as possible, with as little code as is required to accomplish the task. **(Rapid Prototyping)**
**Liability clause:** You use this code at your own risk, I assume no responsibility for how these ideas are used in the future and the fallout of one's bad decisions.
**Transparency clause:** I often lean on AI to assist in creating thw code frameworks and do not want to mislead people that I'm writing these entirely on my own.
**Documentation clause:** I attempt to make all code well-documented and readable, this means there's "fluff" within the code that can be trimmed down after deployment, the *instructions* are within the code for convenience and portability.
